# Lid-Driven-Cavity-simulation-using-SIMPLE-Algorithm-MATLAB-
Simulation of a Lid Driven Cavity flow by implementing the SIMPLE algorithm on MATLAB. The top wall is moving with a constant x-velocity of 1 m/s. All the other walls are stationary, and the kinematic viscosity $$(\nu)$$ is taken to be 0.01 $$m^2/s$$. A finite volume approach with an explicit scheme is applied within the SIMPLE algorithm. 

The program is written in MATLAB, and necessary figures are plotted. These include the centreline x and y velocities, and also the pressure and velocity contours. This project was done as part of the ME 605: Computational Fluid Dynamics Course.
